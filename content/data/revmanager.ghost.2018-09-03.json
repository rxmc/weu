It is urgent to show something genuine, that connects with the buyer. We need to capture attention by offering something of genuine value. Storytelling is no more than creating a personal approach behind a prescriptive message that makes the product unique. It can be used on the website, on social networks or where you have contact with your target audience.\\nVideo content is much more profitable than a still image, it is more personal. Take advantage! This type of content is the most easily consumed, regardless of the time or place where they do it.\\n\\n### **Customizing the shopping experience**\\nDemand knows what it wants and how it wants. Consumers are becoming increasingly demanding when it comes to personalized services on an online shopping experience. As they navigate the web, information roads are left behind as demographics, such as preferences and views. Armed with all this information from our target audience, we are able to put together an incisive strategy and get to it in an effective way, through a tailor-made approach.\\nManaging a vast list of analytical tools about our visitor behavior on our website, we will be able to monitor the individual customer and thus offer products tailored to them, such as recommendations based on their behavior.\\n\\n### **Demand Segmentation**\\nThe possibility of acting in the market with a mesh adjusted to our client, promotes the sale of our product to those who are really interested in it. Our knowledge about the client is crucial. After identifying our \\\"Traveler Personas\\\", creations of the ideal client type for your business, we can move forward with the strategy to get them. In this way we not only increase our potential sales, as these personas will only receive messages that are relevant to them, avoiding the \\\"noise\\\" of to much information and non-relevant at  all.\\n\\n### **Mapping Buying Process**\\nContrary to popular belief, the buying process does not translate into a simple ABC path. Buying behavior differs from person to person and this can complicate the way each company reaches its customer, in a stage increasingly competitive for attention. \\nOne of several ways we get to our customer is through Retargeting. This tool displays ads based on what people have previously visited or searched for, to put more emphasis on customer preferences. Imagine if a customer who visits a particular website with a specific offer, when leaving this website, the offer they were considering buying will be presented as an advertisement while visiting other websites, as well as advertising the website that we previously visited.

One of the most common ways is, highlight at the time of purchase, how many rooms there are available for a certain date. This urgency is one of the most powerful and action-motivating tools, and a countdown is perfect to convey that feeling.\\nSocial proofing is also widely used in e-commerce. Reviews and testimonies left by clients after their purchase are disseminated in order to convince potential clients to buy. This way they are clarifying any fears that potential customers may have regarding the product.\\n\\n### **Hotel Virtual Reality Tours**\\nVirtual Reality is a great way to get the prospective client to reach the long-awaited experience, even before the purchase. By making virtual visits available to our hotel, we safeguard ourselves from potential customer failures with it in our home, since the offer will be visible in a more honest, real and clear way. Not only the rooms are presented this way, but also the outdoor space, public areas and even the breakfast offer.\\ne-commerce has opened new business opportunities across all types of industries and hotel industry can not ignore its importance, the viability of the their business may depend on it.

If this change is not possible, we may lose the conversion here. Therefore, being present on more than one platform, becoming Omni-channel, is essential.\\n> \\\"85% of online shoppers start buying in one device and end up in another.\\\"\\n\\nA consistent image, with identical accessibility across all channels - social networking, desktop / mobile website, physical space -  can significantly increase the possibility of sale, through a sense of identification and even familiarity.\\n\\n### **Accessibility and Mobile**\\nThe ease with which we navigate the website and the simplicity with which a purchase is processed is essential for sales growth. The whole course has to be intuitive and short. Most users use their mobile phone to browse and make purchases if the website is responsive and easy to use on this platform.

Do not neglect the weight of photos, these should be lightweight for instant loading.\\n\\n### **SEO[^2] and SEM[^3]**\\nOptimize your entire website with relevant content. There are several techniques for this purpose. Analyze and choose which keywords are right for your content as it identifies you and positions you favorably on an organic search on any search engine. The titles are of extreme importance, they are determining for a good ranking.

It increases the conversion in the first case, as it makes the guest a\nrepeater, in the second case.\n\nIncrease Website Conversion Triggers\nThe evolution of e-commerce, its popularity and importance among all online\nbusinesses has meant that there are more and more options to capitalize on\nso-called Psychological Triggers in order to convert potential clients into\neffective sales. From Storytelling, Sense of Community, there are several ways\nto reach the client from a more emotional point of view. Clients are human\nbeings with fears, needs and desires, and the online market is the ideal place\nto use these triggers.\nNo doubt that these Triggers can also be used in the hotel industry, we sell\nexperiences and nothing is more emotional than the experiences. One of the most\ncommon ways is, highlight at the time of purchase, how many rooms there are\navailable for a certain date. This urgency is one of the most powerful and\naction-motivating tools, and a countdown is perfect to convey that feeling.\nSocial proofing is also widely used in e-commerce. Reviews and testimonies left\nby clients after their purchase are disseminated in order to convince potential\nclients to buy. This way they are clarifying any fears that potential customers\nmay have regarding the product.\n\nHotel Virtual Reality Tours\nVirtual Reality is a great way to get the prospective client to reach the\nlong-awaited experience, even before the purchase. By making virtual visits\navailable to our hotel, we safeguard ourselves from potential customer failures\nwith it in our home, since the offer will be visible in a more honest, real and\nclear way. Not only the rooms are presented this way, but also the outdoor\nspace, public areas and even the breakfast offer.\ne-commerce has opened new business opportunities across all types of industries\nand hotel industry can not ignore its importance, the viability of the their\nbusiness may depend on it. The use of new technologies, with a focus on the\ncustomer, their experiences, investment in information and tailor-made services,\nis imperative today in order to win the fight with better conversion rates.\n\nOmni-Channel Approach\nMany users start the buying process on one platform and change the middle to\nanother. If this change is not possible, we may lose the conversion here.\nTherefore, being present on more than one platform, becoming Omni-channel, is\nessential.\n\n\"85% of online shoppers start buying in one device and end up in another.\"\n\nA consistent image, with identical accessibility across all channels - social\nnetworking, desktop / mobile website, physical space - can significantly\nincrease the possibility of sale, through a sense of identification and even\nfamiliarity.\n\nAccessibility and Mobile\nThe ease with which we navigate the website and the simplicity with which a\npurchase is processed is essential for sales growth. The whole course has to be\nintuitive and short. Most users use their mobile phone to browse and make\npurchases if the website is responsive and easy to use on this platform.\nOptimize website pages for these devices, either through responsive design or\nthrough AMPs [1]. Ensure that pages are loaded immediately, correctly, and\neasily for all users. Do not neglect the weight of photos, these should be\nlightweight for instant loading.\n\nSEO[2]  and SEM[3]\nOptimize your entire website with relevant content. There are several techniques\nfor this purpose. Analyze and choose which keywords are right for your content\nas it identifies you and positions you favorably on an organic search on any\nsearch engine. The titles are of extreme importance, they are determining for a\ngood ranking. Be careful not to duplicate information, all content must be\nunique on each page, as well as free of spelling errors, otherwise it will be\npenalized.\nWhile SEO seeks to target a better search result in an organic search, SEM uses\nmultiple paid methods to promote your website and direct traffic through various\ntools like Search Engines and social media advertising, taking advantage of the\nefficiency of the segmentation of your business .\nThe use of SEO and SEM leads to a valuable visibility for the hotelier and this\nshould assign these skills to accredited managers to accomplish it.\n\nAlways have a scheduled refresh to the content, as well as a regular interaction\nwith your target audience. Stay current with the trends all the time, you can\nalways analyze what the competition is practicing. Do not be afraid to dive into\nnew strategies, because nowadays, getting static is giving up.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.

That does not mean you have to have the best price available, but your offer will have to be the one that adds the most value to that type of customer. Packages with honest value (whose sum of the parts is greater than the package purchase) and exclusive offers or promotions, several are the techniques to capture a purchase on your website.\\n\\n> Errors in loading prices or offers, delays when sending the data, and mismanagement of inventory availability can lead to a lack of price parity.

We constantly fall into the temptation to have a complex list of products / room types, ending with an intricate list of terms and conditions. OTAs, on the other hand, have simple processes, people can find quickly what is sought, compare prices and finalize the purchase without major restrictions. It is this clarity and simplicity that we have to follow on our side. Remember that the more room types we offer, the less availability we will have for each of them, and if a customer is faced with a lack of availability, we lose to OTAs, as its base typology will certainly have more availability. \\nSimple typologies and prices in the first stage capture the attention, and in the next step, we come up with suggestions for upgrading or offers packaged together, is undoubtedly the solution we are looking for.\\n \\n> We can not forget the Booking Terms and Conditions. If it is very restricted, the client will look for other alternatives. Many OTAs are adept at working with this flexibility of purchase that your customer needs.\\n \\n### **Long and complex shopping process**\\nAgain, clarity and simplicity throughout the customer's  \\\"journey\\\" until the payment step. Nowadays this point is easier to manage, taking into account the wide range of Booking Engine softwares available in the market.\\n \\n> Almost every Booking Engine that has great performances, the buying process is fluid, simple, and is highly responsive. For an effective reservation it should not take much more than 3 clicks for a direct booking.\\n \\n### **Distrust in the website or reservation process**\\nA large percentage of people turn to review websites or friends before moving on to a purchase. In this way there is confirmation of whether or not the product has the value that is displayed on the website. The same confidence that we want the customer to feel with our product has to be identified under our conditions, otherwise the potential client will abandon the purchase because they feel being called into question..\\n\\nThey may also lose their confidence when they have to read extensive Terms and Conditions, when are asked for deposits, when rates are non-refundable or when that information was not transmitted at an earlier stage of the purchase process. People do not feel comfortable entering credit card details even if there is no charge on it.\\n\\nWe will have to be honest and trustworthy, taking the customer to buy in a reliable environment, with all the security and comfort as if they were in the hotel itself.\\n \\n> When someone chooses a hotel and a product, they expect it to be a simple, clear and honest process.

However, it turns out that much of this traffic gets\nlost in our booking engine.\n\nWe must put ourselves in the perspective of the visitor and detect the\nconstraints that may affect their shopping experience and consequent lack of\ndirect booking. An outdated booking engine, as well as being unattractive, is\nnot user friendly and not simple for our prospective client. Recent studies\npoint to an effective conversion close to 2% in direct bookings. What happened\nto the remaining 98%? It is here that we focus our attention and realize what\nmay have gone wrong. What difficulties did they have? What distractions or\nlosses of interest have led to the abandonment of the purchase? Since our point\nof view may be \"infected\" due to involvement in the creation process, to\nminimize this, we can do the following: Ask a group of non-hotel friends to make\nsome test reservations and share their findings. You will get truly amazing\nresults!\n\nWhat constraints or barriers may the potential client encounter during their\nattempt to purchase? There are several impediments you may encounter, however,\nwe highlighted four key points:\n\n 1. They do not like what they see\n 2. They do not find what they want\n 3. Process is long and complex\n 4. Distrust in website and company\n\nConsumers do not like what they see\nConsumers are becoming increasingly attentive and demanding, as they search and\nnavigate in an efficient way to get the best price. That does not mean you have\nto have the best price available, but your offer will have to be the one that\nadds the most value to that type of customer. Packages with honest value (whose\nsum of the parts is greater than the package purchase) and exclusive offers or\npromotions, several are the techniques to capture a purchase on your website.\n\nErrors in loading prices or offers, delays when sending the data, and\nmismanagement of inventory availability can lead to a lack of price parity. This\ninconsistency is reflected in the choice of hotel.\n\nClarity and simplicity in the offer\nWe want to sell everything to everyone, and this mistake can be fatal. We\nconstantly fall into the temptation to have a complex list of products / room\ntypes, ending with an intricate list of terms and conditions. OTAs, on the other\nhand, have simple processes, people can find quickly what is sought, compare\nprices and finalize the purchase without major restrictions. It is this clarity\nand simplicity that we have to follow on our side. Remember that the more room\ntypes we offer, the less availability we will have for each of them, and if a\ncustomer is faced with a lack of availability, we lose to OTAs, as its base\ntypology will certainly have more availability.\nSimple typologies and prices in the first stage capture the attention, and in\nthe next step, we come up with suggestions for upgrading or offers packaged\ntogether, is undoubtedly the solution we are looking for.\n\nWe can not forget the Booking Terms and Conditions. If it is very restricted,\nthe client will look for other alternatives. Many OTAs are adept at working with\nthis flexibility of purchase that your customer needs.\n\nLong and complex shopping process\nAgain, clarity and simplicity throughout the customer's \"journey\" until the\npayment step. Nowadays this point is easier to manage, taking into account the\nwide range of Booking Engine softwares available in the market.\n\nAlmost every Booking Engine that has great performances, the buying process is\nfluid, simple, and is highly responsive.

Although these techniques of Revenue Management that help to boost the moments of growth, become more effectiveness, relevant and priceless in times of economic downturn.\\n \\nIn those moments, they can be the difference between life and death of a company or represent the difference between negative or positive results at the end of the economic period.  Experienced managers know that business restructurings and process reengineering should not be done in times of crisis. These implementations must be done in times of prosperity, where we can take some risk or actions that could take some time to achieve the goals we have set in medium and long-term period.\\n \\nNow, in a context where other alternative tourism markets rise again from the ashes, this issue seems to be too relevant again for sector companies. It's a certainty that will be a moment of contraction in demand again, sooner or later, it becomes a reality. Markets such as North Africa or even some countries from the emerging Middle East are a strong competition for the national (Portuguese) tourism market in the future.\\n \\n> How can we fight these hard times when supply exceeds demand?\\n \\nIf we assume that hotel managers are doing their homework and implement efficiently revenue management procedures and systems, we could divide these actions into four main categories studied by Sheryl Kimes [^1] and Chris Anderson [^2].\\n \\n**1. Rate discounts or reductions\\n2. Rate opacity\\n3. Marketing\\n4. Cuts in operating costs**\\n\\nIn these groups from analysis we look the most efficient, regarding the increase of revenue and optimization in periods of crisis and we became achieving some surprising results. Usually, we can say that the practices that increase value for customer and capture new market segments are able to resist more effectively in times of economic downturn, obtaining superior key indicators of performance when compared with the average. We can easily conclude that actions associated with group 2) Rate Opacity and 3) Marketing become preponderant in success of business units in those troubled times.\\n \\n**1. Rate discounts or reductions**\\nThey consist in discounts concessions or carry out a rate reduction in a decontextualized way, without any prior conditions or barriers. Instead of creating value they create an inverse movement in the market or dumping, contrary to its main objective. This is seen as one of the least efficient resource measures from the point of view of performance indicators. However, this not mean that it is not beneficial when applied with discretion and with useful restrictions.\\nExample: When we offer a discount on special dates with a condition when booking (birthdays, over 65 in low season, large families), guests loyalty (for 3 repeated visits or more) or when we want to reinforce the OTA’s ranking boosting the \\\" Billboard Effect \\\" by creating a \\\" limited time offer or service \\\" special rate (very useful in competitive urban centers).\\n \\n> Discounts on rates are one of the most used instruments in the industry, however when used erratically and without strategy can be harmful to the KPI’s leading to the decrease of revenue. We recommend using them outside the periods of high demand and with some fences or conditions for their attribution.\\n \\n**2. Rate Opacity:**\\n \\n- Creation of value added packages for the guest\\n \\nIt consists in the simple creation of pack services under a single price and that represent an effective advantage for those who buy it. The purchase of the services together should be more advantageous than the same purchase separately. Most of the time it’s possible to stimulate the use of other outlets such as Spa, Sports facilities, rooms and much more.\\n \\n- One-night free offer (extra)\\n \\nDepending on our goal, we give an extra night to those who spend at least X number of nights in our hotel, by this way we can dilute the cost per guest stayover with a smaller impact on the unit image when compared to a direct discount.\\n \\n- Using opaque rate channels\\n \\nThe use of opaque rates sometimes is being controversial, when well used, they can be a great ally in the fight against the crisis. In this way, we can minimize price pressure on the image and brand while we are able to make effective sales at a lower value. If we use this kind of strategies, we should have a greater control over the costs of distribution, because we know that the probability of their increase could be real.\\n \\n- Breakfast offer\\n \\nThis already is a common practice within the hotel industry, consisting of the sale of breakfast included in the price of the room. However, its opposite also happens, in moments when we have more freedom we can charge the breakfast separately from accommodation.\\n \\n- 2 for 1 promotion\\n \\nThis tactic can also be used for the purposes of marketing and to promote the hotel unit for a limited time or in a media stream campaign.\\n \\n- Pre-paid vouchers with F&B packages\\n \\nWith these pre-purchase F&B vouchers we have been able to increase the revenue of other outlets in addition to the accommodation, taking some advantage in the profitability of these spaces.\\n \\n- Creation of packages with flights and / or car rental\\n \\nThis is a great and an effective action although for getting some big revenues, this practice requires planning with greater anticipation. It is necessary not to forget that those purchases are made while the customer buys his air ticket. It is more difficult to carry out this option directly, however, there are some OTAs that allow you to make this type of offer, for example as it happens on Expedia.\\n \\n> This category has a high intrinsic value to increase our revenue, many of the practices tested can still be used as an integral part of marketing and promotion activities. These packages with breakfast or F&B, as well as the use of opaque rates and extra night offers are the proven tactics for a more effective contribution to the revenue increase.\\n \\n**3. Marketing:**\\n \\n- New market segments acquisition \\n \\nCapturing and focusing on new market opportunities is one of the most effective elements in these times of crisis, however, it is up to you be able identify these opportunities through the available information on the hotel through BI and Data Mining techniques.\\n \\n- Pay Per Click (PPC)\\n \\nIn the worst times, the acquisition of potential customers is crucial, so taking some PPC actions become essential for all strategy, to acquiring new customers and attracting new segments.\\n \\n- Revenue diversification with other hotel outlets\\n \\nIt’s important to remember that we have other outlets besides accommodation, these kinds of facilities can play a key role in maintaining the hotel alive and for the integration with local community. In Portugal it is not very usual to see hotel units working properly these existing infrastructures to achieve a steady stream of revenues, however this may represent a competitive advantage among competitors.\\n \\n> The category that is directly associated with the marketing effort is the most effective among all the others, so contrary to what normally happens your budgets should be strengthened in times of crisis and not being shortened.\\n \\n**4. Cuts in operating costs:**\\n \\n- Reduction of operating hours\\n- Facilities Closing or operational cancellation\\n \\nRegarding this action highly popular among financial managers, they should not call into question the level of quality of service provided, otherwise it would have an adverse effect on what is desired. One of the elements with a perception as being the most effective from the point of view of revenue Kpi’s will be the closing of facilities for some renewal increments. In this way, we have the temporary closure of a certain area for future service improvements and a fiscal impact advantages through investment.\\n \\n> One of the main goals from the strategic balance of all these elements is to be able to draw up a resource plan for a time of low demand. The important is for hotel units is to achieve consistent strategy and integrate these tactics into their structure to minimize the negative impact on revenue on economic downturn.\\n \\n### Some suggestions for the future are summarized below:\\n \\n- Do not panic and do not fall into temptation to compare good times with worst moments\\n- Make a strategic repositioning of the business unit (competitive set)\\n- Review and measure all distribution channels\\n- Make strategic partnerships\\n- Compete through quality of service and not price\\n- Make some contracts renegotiation with distribution intermediaries and reinforce favourable conditions for opaque rates\\n- Just have greater strategic coherence in all actions taken\\n- Do not drop prices without conditions only driven by fear of failure\\n- Be resistant to rate discounts without conditions for their attribution\\n- Increase your marketing efforts and budgets\\n- Biggest bet on SEO and SEM actions\\n- Increase the effort to capture new market segments\\n- Make a greater investment in PPC\\n- Greater relationships reinforcement with the customers (CRM techniques)\\n- Increase cross selling strategies\\n- Increase marketing efforts at the point of sale\\n- Further staff internal training for up-selling results\\n- Commissions allocation by sales made for internal staff\\n- Consider marketing strategies and actions that generate value\\n- Implement rate opacity techniques\\n- To take advantage of the moments of less demand, carry out some renovations and improvements in the existing infrastructures of business units\\n- Maintain or even increase your quality service levels\\n- Diversify your revenue sources (other outlets)\\n \\n \\n[^1]: Kimes, S.

Experienced managers know that business restructurings and\nprocess reengineering should not be done in times of crisis. These\nimplementations must be done in times of prosperity, where we can take some risk\nor actions that could take some time to achieve the goals we have set in medium\nand long-term period.\n\nNow, in a context where other alternative tourism markets rise again from the\nashes, this issue seems to be too relevant again for sector companies. It's a\ncertainty that will be a moment of contraction in demand again, sooner or later,\nit becomes a reality. Markets such as North Africa or even some countries from\nthe emerging Middle East are a strong competition for the national (Portuguese)\ntourism market in the future.\n\nHow can we fight these hard times when supply exceeds demand?\n\nIf we assume that hotel managers are doing their homework and implement\nefficiently revenue management procedures and systems, we could divide these\nactions into four main categories studied by Sheryl Kimes [1]  and Chris\nAnderson [2].\n\n1. Rate discounts or reductions\n2. Rate opacity\n3. Marketing\n4. Cuts in operating costs\n\nIn these groups from analysis we look the most efficient, regarding the increase\nof revenue and optimization in periods of crisis and we became achieving some\nsurprising results. Usually, we can say that the practices that increase value\nfor customer and capture new market segments are able to resist more effectively\nin times of economic downturn, obtaining superior key indicators of performance\nwhen compared with the average. We can easily conclude that actions associated\nwith group 2) Rate Opacity and 3) Marketing become preponderant in success of\nbusiness units in those troubled times.\n\n1. Rate discounts or reductions\nThey consist in discounts concessions or carry out a rate reduction in a\ndecontextualized way, without any prior conditions or barriers. Instead of\ncreating value they create an inverse movement in the market or dumping,\ncontrary to its main objective. This is seen as one of the least efficient\nresource measures from the point of view of performance indicators. However,\nthis not mean that it is not beneficial when applied with discretion and with\nuseful restrictions.\nExample: When we offer a discount on special dates with a condition when booking\n(birthdays, over 65 in low season, large families), guests loyalty (for 3\nrepeated visits or more) or when we want to reinforce the OTA’s ranking boosting\nthe \" Billboard Effect \" by creating a \" limited time offer or service \" special\nrate (very useful in competitive urban centers).\n\nDiscounts on rates are one of the most used instruments in the industry, however\nwhen used erratically and without strategy can be harmful to the KPI’s leading\nto the decrease of revenue. We recommend using them outside the periods of high\ndemand and with some fences or conditions for their attribution.\n\n2. Rate Opacity:\n\n * Creation of value added packages for the guest\n\nIt consists in the simple creation of pack services under a single price and\nthat represent an effective advantage for those who buy it. The purchase of the\nservices together should be more advantageous than the same purchase separately.\nMost of the time it’s possible to stimulate the use of other outlets such as\nSpa, Sports facilities, rooms and much more.\n\n * One-night free offer (extra)\n\nDepending on our goal, we give an extra night to those who spend at least X\nnumber of nights in our hotel, by this way we can dilute the cost per guest\nstayover with a smaller impact on the unit image when compared to a direct\ndiscount.\n\n * Using opaque rate channels\n\nThe use of opaque rates sometimes is being controversial, when well used, they\ncan be a great ally in the fight against the crisis. In this way, we can\nminimize price pressure on the image and brand while we are able to make\neffective sales at a lower value. If we use this kind of strategies, we should\nhave a greater control over the costs of distribution, because we know that the\nprobability of their increase could be real.\n\n * Breakfast offer\n\nThis already is a common practice within the hotel industry, consisting of the\nsale of breakfast included in the price of the room. However, its opposite also\nhappens, in moments when we have more freedom we can charge the breakfast\nseparately from accommodation.\n\n * 2 for 1 promotion\n\nThis tactic can also be used for the purposes of marketing and to promote the\nhotel unit for a limited time or in a media stream campaign.\n\n * Pre-paid vouchers with F&B packages\n\nWith these pre-purchase F&B vouchers we have been able to increase the revenue\nof other outlets in addition to the accommodation, taking some advantage in the\nprofitability of these spaces.\n\n * Creation of packages with flights and / or car rental\n\nThis is a great and an effective action although for getting some big revenues,\nthis practice requires planning with greater anticipation. It is necessary not\nto forget that those purchases are made while the customer buys his air ticket.\nIt is more difficult to carry out this option directly, however, there are some\nOTAs that allow you to make this type of offer, for example as it happens on\nExpedia.\n\nThis category has a high intrinsic value to increase our revenue, many of the\npractices tested can still be used as an integral part of marketing and\npromotion activities. These packages with breakfast or F&B, as well as the use\nof opaque rates and extra night offers are the proven tactics for a more\neffective contribution to the revenue increase.\n\n3.

The important is for\nhotel units is to achieve consistent strategy and integrate these tactics into\ntheir structure to minimize the negative impact on revenue on economic downturn.\n\nSome suggestions for the future are summarized below:\n * Do not panic and do not fall into temptation to compare good times with worst\n   moments\n * Make a strategic repositioning of the business unit (competitive set)\n * Review and measure all distribution channels\n * Make strategic partnerships\n * Compete through quality of service and not price\n * Make some contracts renegotiation with distribution intermediaries and\n   reinforce favourable conditions for opaque rates\n * Just have greater strategic coherence in all actions taken\n * Do not drop prices without conditions only driven by fear of failure\n * Be resistant to rate discounts without conditions for their attribution\n * Increase your marketing efforts and budgets\n * Biggest bet on SEO and SEM actions\n * Increase the effort to capture new market segments\n * Make a greater investment in PPC\n * Greater relationships reinforcement with the customers (CRM techniques)\n * Increase cross selling strategies\n * Increase marketing efforts at the point of sale\n * Further staff internal training for up-selling results\n * Commissions allocation by sales made for internal staff\n * Consider marketing strategies and actions that generate value\n * Implement rate opacity techniques\n * To take advantage of the moments of less demand, carry out some renovations\n   and improvements in the existing infrastructures of business units\n * Maintain or even increase your quality service levels\n * Diversify your revenue sources (other outlets)\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.

It is necessary to anticipate the needs of clients which\npresupposes that they use the best accounting and management systems for\neffective and efficient decision making [4].\n\nWill it be an asset to apply the USALI system in your property?\nWe point out some of the advantages that can aid in the decision to implement:\n\n * Comparability\n * Uniformity\n * Flexibility and ease of adaptation\n * Management by responsibilities\n * Departmental Accountability\n * Benchmarking tool\n * Detailed Performance Information\n * Colletcing information unable to get from PMS [5]\n\nUSALI will enable the classification, organization and presentation of financial\ninformation in a uniform and consistent manner, thus improving user\ncomprehensibility [6].\n\nBut what does this mean for you as a property manager?\nYou will be able to compare the results of hotels (for example within a hotel\nchain) in a comparative way, regardless of the market in which it is inserted,\nits size or the management model adopted. Only this way can you understand what\nstage you are in and what changes you will have to implement, creating\nguidelines for your management.\n\n * Answering questions like:\n\nYour hotel has services like laundry, restaurant, message service, among others.\nOf course, these services, besides generating revenues, also generate\nmaintenance costs.\n\n * To what extent is it advantageous to maintain these services?\n * Which one is most attractive at the management level?\n * Which of them adds value to clients perception, even if it is not profitable?\n\nAll these questions are very pertinent today, and an accounting system that can\nanswer these questions is vitally important to the survival of the property. It\nbecomes more and more important to bet in management accounting increasingly\nclosed, and which allows all departments to be updated.\n\nAuthors:\nThis article was written in coautorship by  Susana Castro\n[https://revmanager.eu/author/susana/]  and Ivete Pinto\n[https://revmanager.eu/author/ivete/]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.

The price it’s one of\nthe most important elements for bookings or customer decision when compared\ndirectly with completive set, although this is not the only one and often may\neven be irrelevant to the final choice of hotel where you want to stay\novernight.\n\nNot relevant for the final choice? How this is possible?\nEverything is directly related to the concept of value that the consumer gives\nto a certain service that he or she wants to enjoy, when compared with other\ncompeting services on the same level of perceived quality.\n\nWe propose to revise the concept of price and value, the value perceived by the\ncustomer may include material values and quality, benefits of use or property\nand status that is assigned to him or that is provided by service. This\nperception of value can consider diverse characteristics, such as social status,\nage, gender, economic power, cultural elements, what so ever. This phenomenon it\ncan be more or less accentuated. However, we can say that in premium services a\nlow price can be harmful to its sale, because there is a perception of lack of\nquality in product or service by the consumer.\n\n\"Value is the basis of the consumer's decision in the decision-making process\"\n\nIn decision process we have the following elements:\n\n\nOften there is a gap between the monetary amount that is requested, and the\nvalue assigned by the potential guest. When this happens, the purchase is not\ncarried out because he’s not available to pay what is requested, considering the\ncharacteristics of the product or service in question. When the consumer, even\nso, decides to buy becoming a customer and subsequently a guest, he is often\ndissatisfied with the product or service. This happens because the cost that he\ngives to his acquisition and the benefit resulting from its use does not produce\na positive balance [1]. We can represent it mathematically as being:\n\n * Total customer value = Perceived value or Service value - Total acquisition\n   costs\n   \n\n\n\nPrice:  is the monetary amount expressed numerically associated with a product\nor service ($).\n\nValue:  will be the representation of the benefit for those who purchase the\nproduct or service. It is like the balance between the advantages of acquiring\nthe service for its satisfaction and the monetary amount that it was willing to\npay.\n\nIn this equation, the consumer considers tangible and intangible benefits that\nresult in their full satisfaction. The consumer evaluates the quality of the\nservice provided, used materials, intrinsic characteristics of the service, the\nstatus it represents or in narcissistic view its pure ego satisfaction.\n\n\n\nTo succeed in this side effect, we must consider what Lovelock [2]  and Wirtz \n[3]  consider as the fundamental elements for correct evaluation of a service \n[4].\n\n * These elements are the tangible aspects inherent to the service that\n   translate into:\n * created trust\n * responsiveness and time for implementation\n * guarantee of quality service\n * care and empathy created by the service provider with customer\n\nAll those elements, combined with quality factors, are the driving force for a\ncomplete customer satisfaction.\n\nIt should also be noticed that hotel satisfaction has three distinct moments,\nbefore arrival at the hotel, during the stay and after the stay. They all\ninfluence positively or negatively customer satisfaction.\n\nProcedures and actions of THRM [5]  help identify those elements and influence\nthe perceived value of the customer, making them apt and available to spend a\nhigher monetary amount to buy the service.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.
